I have created a repository with an example approach [here](https://github.com/MRKonrad/dllPlayground)

# VS, Windows and dlls
VS in Windows needs declarations like ```__declspec(dllexport)``` and  ```__declspec(dllimport).``` The generate appropriate declarations is to use cmake's ```generate_export_header``` like this:
```cmake
include(GenerateExportHeader)
generate_export_header(mylib)
```
This way declaration of ```MYLIB_EXPORT``` is placed in the mylib_EXPORT.h file and can be used in a header like this:
```cpp
MYLIB_EXPORT void myfunctionApi();
```
# Templates
Templates are not instantiated in dynamic libraries. To deal with it, if you know what type you are going to use, you can use explicit template instantiation, i.e.
```cpp
template class MYLIB_EXPORT myclass<int>;
template class MYLIB_EXPORT myclass<double>;
```
With templates, one usually writes declaration in a .h file and definition (implementation) in .hxx file. To make implementation visible from .h file, one can ```#include "mylib.hxx"``` at the end of .h file. In libraries we do not want to share the implementation, so one can export .h files in the include folder and surround the ```include .hxx``` with guard
```cpp
#ifdef mylib_EXPORTS
#include "mylib.hxx"
#endif
```
The compiler knows how to deal with ```mylib_EXPORTS``` thanks to setting the ```add_library``` to ```SHARED```. You can see it during verbose build.
